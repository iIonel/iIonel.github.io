Hi, Iâ€™m Ionel ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by **technology** â€” both on the hardware and software side. My passions range from **CNC machines and laser engraving** to **databases, system design, and backend development**.

Recently, Iâ€™ve started a small business in **laser engraving**. Iâ€™m currently working with an **Acmer S1 (6W)** â€” a beginner-friendly machine thatâ€™s perfect for learning, experimenting, and building the foundation for more advanced projects. For me, itâ€™s not just about engraving materials, but also about understanding the mechanics, precision, and creative possibilities behind these tools.

On the software side, I enjoy exploring how complex systems are designed and optimized â€” whether itâ€™s how databases handle millions of queries or how backend architectures scale reliably.  

This blog is where I share my journey â€” from hands-on projects with CNCs and laser engraving to deep dives into software engineering. Itâ€™s both a personal space to document what I learn and a way to connect with others who share the same interests.
